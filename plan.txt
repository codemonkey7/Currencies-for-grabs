Step 0:

1. Create a new Repo in github
2. Save the git URL for use in the next step

Step 1:

1. Install angular using npm
2. Initialize an angular app
3. Name it Currencies for Grabs
4. Initialize git, and set upstream to git URL from previous step
5. Commit and push

Step 2:

1. Create a new service to fetch currency values from api
2. Create individual fetch methods for the three types of data needed
3. Some of the calls can't be made as they are part of the paid plan
4. After a quick test, the paid plans do not return an error just the basic data again
5. Decided to future proof the app by creating proper API URL's even though it does not work
